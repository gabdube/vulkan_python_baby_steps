Collection of toy projects I coded to tech myself Vulkan, the best GPU api ever.

Each top level python file is a standalone program.

Modules under `untils` and `vulkan` are incomplete and should not be used in other projects.

If you are on windows and you have nuitka installed, `nuitka_build` will compile the programs into standalone executable.

Feel free to use them as inspiration.

I think Python 3.6 is required to run them.
